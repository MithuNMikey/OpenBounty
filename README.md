"OpenBounty" – Web3 GitHub Contributor Reward System

Description:
OpenBounty is a decentralized platform that bridges the gap between open source contribution and cryptocurrency rewards. 
The platform automatically tracks accepted pull requests on GitHub repositories and rewards contributors with cryptocurrency 
when their PRs are merged. This incentivizes developers to contribute to open source projects while providing project maintainers
with a structured way to fund development through bounties. OpenBounty creates a transparent, trustless ecosystem where contributors 
can be confident they'll be compensated for their work, and project owners can effectively allocate resources to prioritized issues.
